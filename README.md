In this project I have build off of Clement Mihailescu "Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial" and learn how to implement other types of pathfinding algorithms along with learning the types of algorithms used in maze generator. Sources for some of my solutions I have based off of in my implementation are posted but links below.
